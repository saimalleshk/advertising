# Advertising

# Description

In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on ad based off the features of that user.

The dataset contains the following features.

'Daily Time Spent on Site': Consumer time on site in minutes.
'Age': Customer age in years.
'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
'Daily Internet Usage': Avg.minutes a day consumer is on the internet
'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
'City': City of consumer
'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
'Country': Country of consumer.
'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window.
'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad

## Import 

## Get the Data

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's use seaborn to explore the data!

Create Plots

## Logistic RegressionÂ¶

Now it's tiem to do a trian test split, and train our model!

Split the data into training set and testing set using train_test_split

## Train and fit a logistic regression model on the training set

## Predictions and Evaluations

Now Predict values for the testing data.

## Create a classification report for the model.

## Conclusion

Since we have classified which age are spending more time and all. Now with the logistic model we can see that the model is working fine with good precision rate.
